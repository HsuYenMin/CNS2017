Sometimes the script fails. Just try again.
# problem 4:
run `python3 code4.py`.
# problem 5:
run `python3 code5.py`, you may need to try multiple times until you succeed.
# problem 6:
run `python3 -i code6.py` or `ipython3 -i code6.py`(recommended)
the script will solve the char that are ' ' in plaintext.(with some failure. You need to fix it manually.)
you should manually assign value to the 2-D list `answers` and use functions `sync(ciphers,answers)` and `display(answers)` to show if your guess is right.
# problem 7:
run `python3 code7,py`
# problem 8:
run `python3 code8.py`, it will put the possible flags into possibleFlags.txt
The process will take some time, and during the running you can also do `cat possibleFlags.txt` to examine whether the process had found the flag.
